// Q3. Volume Of Sphere

// Problem Description
/*
 
You are given a positive integer A denoting the radius of a sphere. You have to calculate the volume of the sphere.
Volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * Ï€ * R3) / 3.
NOTE: Since, the answer can be a real number, you have to return the ceil value of the volume. Ceil value of a real number X is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to X.
 */

/*Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 400
 */

//Input Format
//First and only argument is an integer A.

//Output Format
//Return a single integer denoting the ceil value of volume of the sphere.


//YOUR CODE GOES HERE
//JAva

import java.lang.Math;
public int solve(final int A) {
       double pie = Math.PI;  


        double  volume= (4*pie*A*A*A)/(3);

        return (int)Math.ceil(volume);

 }

//Example Input
//Input 1:
//A = 1


//Input 2:
//A = 4


////Example Output
//Output 1:
// 5

//Output 2:
// 269

//Explanation 1:
//Volume of sphere having radius 1 units = 4.19
//Ceil value of volume = 5 

//Explanation 2:
//Volume of sphere having radius 4 units = 268.08
//Ceil value of volume = 269
